1. Service will be like FUNCTION , less dependencies .
2. Service will be like FUNCTION , a single responsibility

Service , RSIService will only return RSI
RSIManager will pass into data for RSI and also add things to it or add it to Ignite or Database

Service class have no dependencies , like no db ,etc and also have business logic in there

THis is in future RSIService dont need to care whether data is from IGNITE or from DATABASE
you can have one that use database and another that use IGNITE both can get RSI

Manager :
1. Get all data ready for service class ( remove db / ignite dependencies )
2. LOGIC
